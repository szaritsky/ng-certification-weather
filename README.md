## Note from Slava Zaritsky
* I tried to stay as close as possible to mock up screens available thru instruction document.
* Will need more styling to be applied to align and adjust html elements.
* No unit test was developed as part of this exercise.
* Used only 4 weather conditions based are on the test requerements while Open Weather Map API has more.
* Took a liberty and added error handling while adding invalid zip code in 'Add a Location' compoment
* In general - no error handling.
